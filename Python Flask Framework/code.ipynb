    "This is an HTML file that uses htmx and Bootstrap 5 to create a simple todo list frontend. htmx is a JavaScript library that allows you to add AJAX and WebSockets functionality to your website using HTML attributes. Bootstrap 5 is a popular CSS framework that provides pre-built styles for common UI elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `head` section of the HTML file, we include the Bootstrap 5 CSS file and the htmx JavaScript file from their respective CDNs. This allows us to use the features of both libraries in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `body` section, we have a `div` with the class `container` that centers our content on the page and adds some margin at the top. Inside this `div`, we have an `h1` element that displays the title of our todo list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the title, we have another `div` that uses htmx attributes to load the todo list items from the server when the page loads. The `hx-get` attribute specifies the URL to send a `GET` request to, and the `hx-target` attribute specifies the element to update with the response. The `hx-trigger` attribute specifies when to send the request, in this case, when the page loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this `div`, we have another `div` with the id `todo-list`. This is where our todo list items will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the todo list, we have a `form` element that allows us to add new items to our todo list. The form uses htmx attributes to send a `POST` request to the server when the form is submitted. The `hx-post` attribute specifies the URL to send the request to, and the `hx-target` attribute specifies the element to update with the response. The `hx-swap` attribute specifies how to update the target element, in this case, by replacing its inner HTML with the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the form, we have an `input-group` that contains an `input` element for entering new todo items and a `button` for submitting the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a simple example of how you can use htmx and Bootstrap 5 to create a todo list frontend. You can customize it further by adding more features or changing its appearance.\n",
