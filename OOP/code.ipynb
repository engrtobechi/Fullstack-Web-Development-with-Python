    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize and structure code. In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which define the attributes and behaviors of the objects. Classes can be thought of as blueprints for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class and a colon. The body of the class is indented and contains the methods (functions) and attributes (variables) of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method is a special method called a constructor, which is called when an object is created from the class. The `self` parameter refers to the object being created, and is used to set the initial values of the object's attributes.\n",
